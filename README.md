## Tasks

Your task is to develop one (or more, feel free) RESTful service(s) to:
* Create a **Store**
* Update a **Store** information
* Retrieve a **Store** by parameters
* Create an **Order** with items
* Create a **Payment** for an **Order**
* Retrieve an **Order** by parameters
* Refund **Order** or any **Order Item**

Fork this repository and submit your code with partial commits.

## Business Rules

* A **Store** is composed by name and address
* An **Order** is composed by address, confirmation date and status
* An **Order Item** is composed by description, unit price and quantity.
* A **Payment** is composed by status, credit card number and payment date
* An **Order** just should be refunded until ten days after confirmation and the payment is concluded.

## Non functional requirements

Your service(s) must be resilient, fault tolerant, responsive. You should prepare it/them to be highly scalable as possible.

The process should be closest possible to "real-time", balancing your choices in order to achieve the expected
scalability.

## Nice to have features (describe or implement):
* Asynchronous processing
* Database
* Docker
* AWS
* Security
* Swagger
* Clean Code
